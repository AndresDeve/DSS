#### Properties of the t Distribution
The t distribution has the following properties:

- The mean of the distribution is equal to 0 .
- The variance is equal to v / ( v - 2 ), where v is the degrees of freedom and v > 2.
- The variance is always greater than 1, although it is close to 1 when there are many degrees of freedom. 
- With infinite degrees of freedom, the t distribution is the same as the standard normal distribution.

#### Likelihood
In statistics, a likelihood function is a function of the parameters of a statistical model, defined as follows: the likelihood of a set of parameter values given some observed outcomes is equal to the probability of those observed outcomes given those parameter values. 

Likelihood functions play a key role in statistical inference, especially methods of estimating a parameter using statistics (a function of the data).

#### Confidence Intervals
- In statistical inference, one wishes to estimate population parameters using observed sample data.
- A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range being calculated from a given set of sample data.

#### Bayes Inference
- Bayesian inference is a method of inference in which Bayes' rule is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired. -
- Bayesian updating is an important technique throughout statistics, and especially in mathematical statistics. For some cases, exhibiting a Bayesian derivation for a statistical method automatically ensures that the method works as well as any competing method.
- Bayesian updating is especially important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application in a range of fields including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine and law.
