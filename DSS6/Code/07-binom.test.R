# A binomial test compares the number of successes observed in a given number of trials with a hypothesised probability of success.
# The test has the null hypothesis that the real probability of success is equal to some value denoted p, and the alternative
# hypothesis that it is not equal to p. 
# The test can also be performed with a one-sided alternative hypothesis that the real probability of success 
# is either greater than p or that it is less than p.
