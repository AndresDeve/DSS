## Normal probability plot
 
## A normal probability plot is a plot for a continuous variable that helps to determine whether a sample is
## drawn from a normal distribution. 
## If the data is drawn from a normal distribution, the points will fall approximately in a straight line. 
## If the data points deviate from a straight line in any systematic way, it suggests that the data is not drawn 
## from a normal distribution.

qqnorm(trees$Height) 
qqline(trees$Height)

## There is also a function called qqplot which allows you to create quantile plots for comparing data with 
## other standard probability distributions besides the normal distribution. 
## Enter help(qqplot) for more details.
