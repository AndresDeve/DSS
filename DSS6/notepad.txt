Continuing our dice simulationâ€¦
We talked about:

Which sample (n =5, 20, or 500) is likely to have a distribution closest to the theoretical distribution?
Which sample is likely to have a mean closest to the theoretical mean?
Will the largest sample always be the one that comes closest to the theoretical values?
(Casey's point) How are the variances of the different samples likely to differ?
Question for you:

If you had to bet which sample would have the largest variance, which sample would you bet on?
If you had to bet which sample would have the smallest variance, which sample would you bet on?

Variance
So, let's talk for a second about variance before moving on.

Theoretically, for a random variable, if \(X\) is a random variable with mean \(\mu\), the variance of \(X\) is defined as

\[ Var(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \]

The sample variance from a sample of data is \[ S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1} (X_i - \bar X)^2}{n-1} \]

Variance
From the variance lecture:

What's the variance from the result of a toss of a die?

\(E[X] = 3.5\)
\(E[X^2] = 1 ^ 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 2 ^ 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 3 ^ 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 4 ^ 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 5 ^ 2 \times \frac{1}{6} + 6 ^ 2 \times \frac{1}{6} = 15.17\)

\(Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 \approx 2.92\)

Variance
From our three samples:

var(sim.1)  ## 5 rolls
## [1] 4
var(sim.2)  ## 20 rolls
## [1] 1.937
var(sim.3)  ## 500 rolls
## [1] 3.007

Simulating lots of rolls of each size
So far, we've only simulated a single roll of each sample size, and we've talked about what we expect from the different samples.

Now let's check our expectations by simulating many different dice rolls for each sample size and seeing how the means and variances of these samples actually behave.

Simulating lots of rolls of each size
First, let's set up a dataframe with the values from our simulation. For example, we can create a matrix with 1,000 simulations of five rolls with:

nosim <- 1000 ## Number of samples we'll simulate
sim.1 <- matrix(sample(c(1:6), 5*nosim, replace = TRUE),
                nrow = nosim)
head(sim.1)
##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    6    3    4    2    5
## [2,]    3    1    6    4    1
## [3,]    5    2    2    2    2
## [4,]    2    3    6    3    1
## [5,]    3    4    5    4    2
## [6,]    6    3    4    2    6


Simulating lots of rolls of each size
In R, you can use the apply function to perform the same function on all columns or rows of a matrix.

So, to get the mean of all of the samples with 5 rolls, we can run:

sim.1.mn <- apply(sim.1, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)
sim.1.mn[1:5]
## [1] 4.0 3.0 2.6 3.0 3.6
And to get the variance:

sim.1.var <- apply(sim.1, MARGIN = 1, FUN = var)
sim.1.var[1:5]
## [1] 2.5 4.5 1.8 3.5 1.3
