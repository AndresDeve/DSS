### What is a Random Variable?

A random variable, usually written X, is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous.

#### Discrete Random Variables
- A discrete random variable is one which may take on only a countable number of distinct values such as 0,1,2,3,4,........ - Discrete random variables are usually (but not necessarily) counts. 
- If a random variable can take only a finite number of distinct values, then it must be discrete. 
- Examples of discrete random variables include the number of children in a family, the Friday night attendance at a cinema, the number of patients in a doctor's surgery, the number of defective light bulbs in a box of ten.

#### Continuous Random Variables

A continuous random variable is one which takes an infinite number of possible values. Continuous random variables are usually measurements. Examples include height, weight, the amount of sugar in an orange, the time required to run a mile.
