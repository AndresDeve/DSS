Data Cleaning
=======================

- The act of detecting and removing and/or correcting a database's dirty data (i.e., data that is incorrect, out-of-date, 
redundant, incomplete, or formatted incorrectly). 
- The goal of data cleansing is not just to clean up the data in a 
database but also to bring consistency to different sets of data that have been merged from separate databases. 
- Sophisticated software applications are available to clean a databases data using algorithms, rules and look-up tables, at
ask that was once done manually and therefore still subject to human error.

#### Tidy Data
Raw data in the real-world is often untidy and poorly formatted. Furthermore, it may lack appropriate details of the study. Correcting data in place can be a dangerous exercise since the original raw data would get overwritten and there would be no way to audit this process or recover from mistakes made during this time. A good data practice would be to maintain the original data, but use a programmatic script to clean it, fix mistakes and save that cleaned dataset for further analysis. I
