ANCOVA
===========
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is a general linear model which blends ANOVA and regression. ANCOVA evaluates whether population means of a dependent variable (DV) are equal across levels of a categorical independent variable (IV), while statistically controlling for the effects of other continuous variables that are not of primary interest, known as covariates (CV). 
Therefore, when performing ANCOVA, the DV means are adjusted to what they would be if all groups were equal on the CV.

#### Assumptions
Assumption 1: Normality of Residuals
The residuals (error terms) should be normally distributed.

Assumption 2: Homogeneity of Variances
The error variances should be equal for different treatment classes.

Assumption 3: Homogeneity of Regression Slopes
The slopes of the different regression lines should be equivalent, i.e., regression lines should be parallel among groups.

Assumption 4: Linearity of Regression 
The regression relationship between the dependent variable and concomitant variables must be linear.

Assumption 5: Independence of Error terms 
The error terms should be uncorrelated.
